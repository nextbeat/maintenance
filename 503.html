            <p>Hi, Nextbeat family!</p>
            <p>Nextbeat was an experiment in digital intimacy â€” a place for content creators and Internet warriors to share stories, make friends, and invite our community into their day-to-day lives. We had something special here: a genuinely positive, drama-free community; all the intimacy and presence of livestreaming, without the anxiety and dead air. We built Nextbeat as a bastion of presence and authentic engagement in a time where most platforms only sought to drive clickthroughs. And we built some real friendships along the way!</p>
            <p>Sadly, all good things must come to an end. Nextbeat has shut down for the indefinite future. Thank you for coming on this ride with us! We'll miss you all.</p>
            <p>If you want to keep up with Nextbeat personalities Tyler and Safiya, you can find them on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA">YouTube</a>.</p>   
            <p>All our best,</p>
            <p>Team Nextbeat</p>
